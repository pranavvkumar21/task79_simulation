[33mCMake Warning (dev) at /usr/share/cmake-3.22/Modules/FindPackageHandleStandardArgs.cmake:438 (message):
  The package name passed to `find_package_handle_standard_args` (PkgConfig)
  does not match the name of the calling package (gazebo).  This can lead to
  problems in calling code that expects `find_package` result variables
  (e.g., `_FOUND`) to follow a certain pattern.
Call Stack (most recent call first):

[31mCMake Error at CMakeLists.txt:30 (find_package):
  By not providing "Findrealsense_ros_gazebo.cmake" in CMAKE_MODULE_PATH this
  project has asked CMake to find a package configuration file provided by
  "realsense_ros_gazebo", but CMake did not find one.

  Could not find a package configuration file provided by
  "realsense_ros_gazebo" with any of the following names:

    realsense_ros_gazeboConfig.cmake
    realsense_ros_gazebo-config.cmake

  Add the installation prefix of "realsense_ros_gazebo" to CMAKE_PREFIX_PATH
  or set "realsense_ros_gazebo_DIR" to a directory containing one of the
  above files.  If "realsense_ros_gazebo" provides a separate development
  package or SDK, be sure it has been installed.
