# Mission Data Management

In order to save space in the repo, the mission data files are ignored by git.

The recommended organisation for mission data files is:

```
* task79_data_converter/
    * data/
        * mission_data/
            * test_X
                * file_1.csv
                * file_2.csv
            * test_Y
                * file_1.csv
                * file_2.csv
```

For information, curated mission data files can be found on [SharePoint](https://nocacuk.sharepoint.com/:f:/r/sites/NOCMARSTeam/Shared%20Documents/MARS%20On-board%20Control%20Software/NOCS%20Documentation/OCS%20Simulation/ROS%20NOCS%20Simulation/Simulation%20Work/Progeny%20Task%2079%20OCSv3%20%5BApril%202024%5D/resources/mission_data?csf=1&web=1&e=xgCiK6).

Additionally, mission data analysis for raw data can be found on [SharePoint](https://nocacuk.sharepoint.com/:f:/r/sites/NOCMARSTeam/Shared%20Documents/MARS%20On-board%20Control%20Software/NOCS%20Documentation/OCS%20Simulation/ROS%20NOCS%20Simulation/Simulation%20Work/Progeny%20Task%2079%20OCSv3%20%5BApril%202024%5D/resources/mission_analysis?csf=1&web=1&e=v6r1x6).

If the relevant mission data files are not accessible, please send an email to the package author (cf. `task79_data_converter/package.xml`).
